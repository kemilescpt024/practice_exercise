Always check ReadMe files first!

1. Make sure your tests are functional, there should be 14 ran in total.

2. Check that any technical errors are cleared so that testing may commence. Very small technical
changes needed in the testing file, but no changes needed within the methods themselves.
    2.1 For the most part, VSCode's testing works pretty well so long as all is in order.
    2.2 If you feel you've checked every error and should be able to do testing, but testing isn't
    working, restart VSCode, right click to open new blank window, close, then open your specific
    folder. Should get it working.
    2.3 ctrl + shift + p brings up the littlt window you'd need to configure your testing.

3. Once ready, start coding in exercise_prep.py to assure you pass all the tests.

Good luck.
